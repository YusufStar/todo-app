## My process

### Built with

- SCSS
- Flexbox
- Firebase
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

I've never use Firebase on a React project before, I did it in Angular. This was my first time with React and has been funny

### Continued development

I'd like to fix the issue with the beautiful dnd library, using my own code.
